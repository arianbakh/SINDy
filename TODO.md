# TODO

- DRY: SINDy toolkit

- adaptive lambda

- plot mse vs. complexity in lorentz -> toolkit

- anything other than complexity and mse for cost?

- use a class for data (incl. x, x_dot, adjacency_matrix)

- save each SINDy run output in a different directory named after job type (lorentz, ...) and 
datetime + save library for each run

- shared settings

- _get_theta takes too long, parallelize with numpy operations

- idea: to speed up, select most active node, its neighbors and neighbors of neighbors

- save progress so you can resume
